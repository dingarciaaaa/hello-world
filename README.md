# hello-world

Hello there!
I'm Bernadine E. Garcia, 20 years old, lives in 508 New Frontier St., Mabolo, Cebu City. I am a 2nd year student taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at University of Cebu. I chose this course because I aim to become a Web Developer. Aside from that, I also like taking pictures and play the piano during my spare time. It relaxes me and makes me happy. It saved me during the darkness days of my life. I'm just a human, I have weakness, I make mistakes and I experience sadness; But I learn from all these things to make me a better person. Just like everyone else.
