# hello-world

Hello there!
I'm Bernadine E. Garcia, a 2nd year student taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at University of Cebu. 
I chose this course because I aim to become a Web Developer. Aside from that, I also like taking pictures and play the 
piano during my spare time. It relaxes me and makes me happy. It saved me during the darkness days of my life. I'm a human, I have weakness, I make mistakes and I experience sadness; But I learn from all these things to make me a better person.
