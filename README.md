# hello-world

Hello there!
I'm Bernadine E. Garcia, a 2nd year student taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at University of Cebu. 
I chose this course because I aim to become a Web Developer. Aside from that, I also like taking pictures and play the 
piano during my free time. It relaxes me and makes me happy.
